I am writing to you as a candidate for the visual analysis researcher position in your company.

I am currently finishing my fifth year in the VisGraph Lab of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. My advisor is Prof. Huamin Qu. I anticipate finishing my graduate work at the end of this year. 

In my PhD study, I developed visualization techniques for analyzing the correlation between node attributes and connections in multivariate graph data and for understanding the dynamics of information diffusion in social media data. Besides that, I was also engaged in projects on spatial-temporal data visualization with partners in industry.


My resume attached provides additional information on my background and other projects that i have been working on during my PhD study. Currently I am visitor at Georgia Tech. I will return to Hong Kong on Dec. 11. It might be better to arrange the interview before that. 

Thank you for your consideration. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
